Goal is to create a web application similar to Game of Legends where we can query player specific stats and get a better understanding of how a player performs/has performed in past splits/years.

Currently in the rudimentary process of acquiring necessary metrics to display player stats and from there, compute analysis on the player to understand the role they ideally fit in. 

Once the preliminary analysis is conducted, that information will allow us to understand how different players mesh and play together based on different archetypes (lane dominant, weak side player, herbivore jungler, roaming support, etc.) With these archetypes, team building for general managers (GMs) for teams can utilize the following tool to help them understand the roster construction with more concreteness.

The end goal for this project is to be able to create a form of team builder where users can construct a team based on the previously stated archetypes and statistic analysis along with preditive analysis using a some type of machine learning model (TBD).
