The timeline should have a list of frames, one per minute in the game, 
each one of those frames has information about player stats (participantFrames) 
which gives you stats corresponding to the point in the game the frame represents, 
so first frame has stats at sec 0, second frame at 60s, third frame at 120s

TLDR:
    Frame of each player = participantFrames
    1 Frame = 1 Minute
     -> Frame 1 = 0 seconds
     -> Frame 2 = 60 seconds
     -> Frame 3 = 120 seconds

The list of events that comes together with participantFrames has a list of 
events (item bought, champ killed, ward placed, etc) that happened during the 
minute of game the frame represents, so first frame 0-60s, second 61-120s and so on

For the purposes of analyzing the data, we will be using the timeline_json. This is the actual object
that contains all of the data of that game with all of the activities throughout the game by frame.

From what I can gather, it seems as though the participants are ID'd as such:
    1 - Top 
    2 - Jungle
    3 - Mid
    4 - Bot
    5 - Support
    6 - Top
    7 - Jungle
    8 - Mid
    9 - Bot
    10 - Support

To acquire all of the frames (All events that occurred in the game):
    timeline_json['frames'] - list

As an example, lets use the Dignitas vs 100 Thieves LCS 2023-02-02 (WEEK2) game

timeline_json['frames'][0] - dict
    This will give us the first frame of the game
    This frame will contain all of the events that occurred in the first minute of the game
    This will also contain all of the participantFrames for each player in the game

timeline_json['frames'][0]['participantFrames'] - dict
    This will give us the participantFrames for the first frame of the game
    This will contain all of the stats for each player in the game
    This will also contain the participantId for each player in the game

timeline_json['frames'][0]['participantFrames']['1'] - dict
    This will give us the participantFrame for the first player in the game
    This will contain all of the stats for the first player in the game in that frame
    This will also contain the participantId for the first player in the game

    There are 12 keys in this dictionary. These include:
        championStats - dict
            dictionary containing all of the stats for the champion at that point in time
        currentGold - int
            amount of gold that player currently has on them
        damageStats - dict
            dictionary containing all of the damage stats for the champion at that point in time
        goldPerSecond - int
            amount of gold that player is earning per second
        jungleMinionsKilled - int
        level - int
        minionsKilled - int
        participantId - int
            participantId of the player (would just be the int value after the 'participantFrames')
        position - dict
            dictionary containing the x and y coordinates of the player on summoners rift
        timeEnemySpentControlled - int
            not sure
        totalGold - int
            total gold accrued by that player at that point in time in the game (at frame 0 it will always be 500 for all players)
        xp - int
            amount of xp that player has accrued at that point in time in the game (at frame 0 it will always be 0 for all players)
